summary: An interior design application to draw house plans & arrange furniture
description: |
    Sweet Home 3D is a free interior design application that helps you place
    your furniture on a house 2D plan, with a 3D preview.

    Available at http://www.sweethome3d.com/, this program is aimed at people
    who want to design their interior quickly, whether they are moving or they
    just want to redesign their existing home. Numerous visual guides help you
    draw the plan of your home and layout furniture. You may draw the walls of
    your rooms upon the image of an existing plan, and then, drag and drop
    furniture onto the plan from a catalog organized by categories. Each change
    in the 2D plan is simultaneously updated in the 3D view, to show you a
    realistic rendering of your layout.
